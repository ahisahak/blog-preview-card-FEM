## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties


### What I learned

I learned that the `box-shadow` property in CSS controls the shadowâ€™s position, blur, and visibility. The first value determines the horizontal offset, moving the shadow left or right, while the second value sets the vertical offset, shifting it up or down. The third value, the blur radius, affects how sharp or soft the shadow appears, with `0px` creating a sharp edge. The color, especially when using RGBA, allows for opacity adjustments to make the shadow more or less visible. By setting both offsets and keeping the blur at zero, I can achieve a clean, offset shadow effect like in the image.


### Continued development
I want to continue learning about CSS properties and how to use them effectively in my projects. I also want to practise building responsive designs and layouts for both computer and mobile screens and making them more diverse and visually appealing.
